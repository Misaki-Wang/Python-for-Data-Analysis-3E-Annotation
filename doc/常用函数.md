# Categorical data

`Categoricals` are a pandas data type corresponding to categorical variables in statistics. A categorical variable takes on a limited, and usually fixed, number of possible values 

categorical data might have an order, Order is defined by the order of `categories`, not lexical order of the values.
numerical operations (additions, divisions, …) are not possible.

All values of categorical data are either in `categories` or `np.nan`

the data structure consists of

-  a `categories` array
- an integer array of `codes` which point to the real value in the `categories` array.

The categorical data type is useful in the following cases:

- A string variable consisting of only a few different values.
- The lexical order of a variable is not the same as the logical order
- As a signal to other Python libraries that this column should be treated as a categorical variable
